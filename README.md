### Hi there 👋

I am a senior Mechanical Engineering student at Bilkent University. I have an interest in micro designs, finite element method and robotics. I am a goal-oriented, enthusiastic undergrad student. 

In my profile, you can find 2 projects that implements Finite Element Method in order to analyze beams and trusses:
  ⏺ Beam Bending Analysis GUI
  ⏺ Planar Truss Structure Analyis GUI.
