### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Bilkent University. My interests are micro designs, finite element method and artifical intelligence. I am a goal-oriented, enthusiastic undergrad student.

**In my profile, you can find 2 projects that implement Finite Element Method in order to analyze beams and trusses:**
- [**Beam Bending Analysis MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/BeamBendingAnalysis-MATLAB-Application)
- [**Planar Truss Structure Analyis MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/PlanarTrussStructureAnalysis-MATLAB-Application)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking the "Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science" given by MITX and I am very excited about it ! I am planning to share [**my notes**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/Intro_to_Computational_Thinking_and_Data_Science) as I watch the course videos.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently revising my knowledge of 2D FEM Analysis of Rectangular Domains under various mechanical loadings.
