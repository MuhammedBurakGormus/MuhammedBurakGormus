### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Bilkent University. My interests are micro designs, finite element method and artifical intelligence. I am a goal-oriented, enthusiastic undergrad student.

**In my profile, you can find 3 projects that implement Finite Element Method in order to analyze beams and trusses as well as the deformation of rectangular domains:**
- [**Beam Bending Analysis MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/BeamBendingAnalysis-MATLAB-Application)
- [**Planar Truss Structure Analsyis MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/PlanarTrussStructureAnalysis-MATLAB-Application)
- [**Rectangular Domains Analysis Under Various Mechanical Loadings MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/2DFiniteElement)

The first two projects implement 1-Dimensional Finite Element Method, whereas the last one employs 2-Dimensional Finite Element Method.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking the "Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science" given by MITX and I am very excited about it ! I am planning to share [**my notes**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/Intro_to_Computational_Thinking_and_Data_Science) as I watch the course videos.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on 3D FEM Analysis - Creating the Stiffness Matrix for a Hexagonal Element with 27 Nodes ...
