### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Bilkent University. My interests are micro designs, finite element method and artifical intelligence. I am a goal-oriented, enthusiastic undergrad student.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on  [**3D FEM to analyze a Soft Robot Body under dynamic motion.**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/SoftRobotBodyDeformation-3DFEM)

**In my profile, you can find 3 projects that implement Finite Element Method in order to analyze beams and trusses as well as the deformation of rectangular domains:**
- [**Beam Bending Analysis MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/BeamBendingAnalysis-MATLAB-Application)
- [**Planar Truss Structure Analysis  MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/PlanarTrussStructureAnalysis-MATLAB-Application)
- [**Rectangular Domains Analysis Under Various Mechanical Loadings MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/2DFiniteElement)

The first two projects implement 1-Dimensional Finite Element Method, whereas the last one employs 2-Dimensional Finite Element Method.

**You can see the work in the scope of Artificial Intelligence below. The first link leads to the project that using AI to solve NY Times 5x5 Crossword Puzzle, and the second link stands for the homeworks consisting of search algorithms.**

- [**NYTimes CrossWord Puzzle Solver by implementing AI**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/NYTimes-CrossWord-Puzzle-Solver)
- [**HWs including search algorithms**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/Artificial-Intelligence-CS461---Homeworks)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m taking the "Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science" given by MITX and I am very excited about it ! I am planning to share [**my notes**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/Intro_to_Computational_Thinking_and_Data_Science) as I watch the course videos.
