### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My interests are finite element method and artifical intelligence. I am a goal-oriented, enthusiastic mechanical engineering graduate who likes to code.

**In my profile, you can find 4 projects that implement Finite Element Method in order to analyze beams, trusses, rectangular domains and soft robot bodies under loadings:**
- [**Beam Bending Analysis MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/BeamBendingAnalysis-MATLAB-Application)
- [**Planar Truss Structure Analysis  MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/PlanarTrussStructureAnalysis-MATLAB-Application)
- [**Rectangular Domains Analysis Under Various Mechanical Loadings MATLAB Application**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/2DFiniteElement)
- [**3D FEM to analyze a Soft Robot Body under dynamic motion.**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/SoftRobotBodyDeformation-3DFEM)

The first two projects implement 1-Dimensional Finite Element Method, whereas the third one employs 2-Dimensional Finite Element Method. The last project includes 3-Dimensional Finite Element Method.

**You can see the project, where I used my AI/ML knowledge within the class Machine Learning Approaches in Structural Mechanics.  
- [**Generating Images with Microstuctures using Variational Autoencoders**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/VariationalAutoEncoders)

**You can also see the project, where I implemented a Lattice-Boltzmann method using python for different computational fluid dynamics problems: 
- [**Lattice Boltzmann Method High Performance Computing**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/HPCSubmission)

**You can see the work in the scope of Artificial Intelligence below. The first link leads to the project that using AI to solve NY Times 5x5 Crossword Puzzle, and the second link stands for the homeworks consisting of search algorithms.**

- [**NYTimes CrossWord Puzzle Solver by implementing AI**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/NYTimes-CrossWord-Puzzle-Solver)
- [**HWs including search algorithms**](https://github.com/MuhammedBurakGormus/Artificial-Intelligence-CS461---Homeworks)
